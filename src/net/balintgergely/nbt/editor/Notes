We will make all classes specialize

NBTEditor
Responsible for interacting with the user, and managing the main thread on an event queue.

TagTreeModel
Responsible for ANY interaction with the underlying Tag data structure including modifications.
Can only be modified from the main thread, so it shares the same event queue with NBTEditor.

FileTreeNode
Responsible for representing a file or directory in the filesystem as a tag, and hosts all IO operations on the file.
